1. If the user is already logged in, and they try to go to the login link then they should be redirected to the homepage, not stay on the login page. Also, if a user is logged out, then navigating to home should not be allowed, but in your case it is, so you should fix that.

2. The logout functionality does not seem to work properly as well, when logging out no data is signifying that the user is logged in is removed or signified that the user is logged out.

3. The search functionality does not work as expected, also after searching the load more functionality does not work anymore, so you should look into that and try to fix it.ðŸ¤”
